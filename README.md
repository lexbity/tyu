# Tyu programming language

### Core idea
A small **concatenative, stack-based** systems language for embedded + simulation:
- no GC
- explicit allocation via **regions**
- **fixed arrays** are core (`T'N`)
- higher-level collections/algorithms live in the **stdlib**
- Ada/SPARK-ish safety tools: **subtypes** + **contracts**
- strong MMIO/representation support

### Build Framework

- cross-compiler targeting platforms
- hosted management tools
